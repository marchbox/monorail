## The author

My name is Zacky Ma. I’m a web developer who loves drawing and Disney. As a web developer, I advocate for making inclusive websites that follows the Web Standards, and I prioritize usability, accessibility, performance, maintainability, and internationalization.


## The design

I grew up in the far west part of mainland China, internet wasn’t a thing until I was in high school. Disney was my window to the outside world. My love towards Disney has driven me through almost all major changes in my life. So I weaved that love into the design of this website.

The website logo is designed as the old Disneyland park entrance sign.

The navigation in the header is a tribute to my favorite [Disney.com design (circa early 2000s)](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/disney-2001 "Link to Web Design Museum"): the main navigation was a monorail referencing the famous Disney Park monorail systems. I thought it was such a clever idea for brand continuation to bring their magic from the real world to the online world.

Unlike today, it was a time when websites looked all different from each other, web design was more experimental and interesting. It seems the industry is trending that direction again, hopefully the web will look more diverse in a few years without bringing back Flash’s closeness, lack of security, and poor accessibility.

The dark mode design is inspired by Disneyland’s classic [Main Street Electrical Parade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Street_Electrical_Parade).


## Acknowledgement

The monospace fonts used in all code samples belong to the font family called [Mono Lisa](https://monolisa.dev). I was going to used Source Code Pro to be consistent with the body type Source Serif Pro and heading type Source Sans Pro. But I do find Mono Lisa’s larger counter and taller x-height design more appealing and legible.

The logotype uses [Parkly](https://simplebits.com/collections/fonts/products/parkly-font), made by the great [SimpleBits](https://simplebits.com). I like that each letter has friendly rounded edges while maintaining a square shape, the friendliness fits the Disneyland vibe and the square shape fits the logo design. Plus, the name!

The website is built with the Node.js-based static site generator, [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). I like its simplicity and flexibility.
