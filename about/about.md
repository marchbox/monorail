## The author

My name is Zacky Mǎ. I’m a web developer who loves drawing and Disney. As a web developer, I enjoy making inclusive websites that follows the Web Standards, and I prioritize usability, accessibility, performance, maintainability, and internationalization.


## The content

The content of the website reflects my personal interests and thoughts.

In the [Articles]({{'/articles'|url}}) section, the 3 main tag include:

- [Pixel]({{'/articles/tag/pixel'|url}}): web design and development.
- [The Mouse]({{'/articles/tag/mouse'|url}}): all things Disney.
- [Dumpling]({{'/articles/tag/dumpling'|url}}): everything else that I’m interested in.

In the [Drawings]({{'/drawings'|url}}) section, I showcases some of my favorite illustrations I’ve done.


## The design

I grew up in the far west part of mainland China, internet wasn’t a thing until I was in high school. Disney was my window to the outside world. My love towards Disney has driven me through almost all major changes in my life. So I weaved that love into the design of this website.

The website logo is designed as the old Disneyland park entrance sign.

The navigation in the header is a tribute to my favorite [Disney.com design (circa early 2000s)](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/disney-2001 "Link to Web Design Museum"): the main navigation was a monorail referencing the famous Disney Park monorail systems. I thought it was such a clever idea for brand continuation to bring their magic from the real world to the online world.

Unlike today, it was a time when websites looked all different from each other, web design was more experimental and interesting. It seems the industry is trending that direction again, hopefully the web will look more diverse in a few years without bringing back Flash’s closeness, lack of security, and poor accessibility.

The dark mode design is inspired by Disneyland’s classic [Main Street Electrical Parade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Street_Electrical_Parade).


## Acknowledgement

The monospace fonts used in all code samples belongs to the font family called [Mono Lisa](https://monolisa.dev). I was going to used Source Code Pro to be consistent with Source Serif Pro and Source Sans Pro, which I use as the heading and body fonts respectively. But I do find Mono Lisa’s larger counter and longer x-height design more appealing and legible, it also looks great in the logo.

The website is built with the Node-based static site generator, [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev). I like its simplicity and flexibility.
