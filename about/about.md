## The author

My name is [Zacky Ma](https://marchbox.com), a Frontend Web Developer who loves Disney, and is passionate about the Web Standards, progressive enhancement, accessibility, typography, and interaction design. I currently work at Niantic as a Web Developer, prior to that, I was at Google for over 10 years as a UX Engineer.

## The design theme

You may have noticed the references to Disney, especially to Disneyland, all over the website. I grew up in the far west part of mainland China, internet wasn’t a thing until I was in high school. Disney was kind of my window to the outside world. My love towards Disney has driven me through almost all major changes in my life, including this website.

The name of the website, Web Components Land, is obviously a reference to Disneyland. As much as I believe we should prioritize clearity over magic in our code, I do find Web Components, or custom elements to be more specific, magic. That’s why I want to use Disney magic as a metaphor in the website deisgn and articles. The website logo is inspired by the old Disneyland park entrance sign, I thought it was perfect for the entrance sign to be the representation of the website.

The navigation in header is a tribute to my favorite [Disney.com design (circa early 2000s)](https://web.archive.org/web/20011109060558/http://disney.go.com/park/homepage/today/html/index.html "Link to Wayback Machine"): the main navigation was a monorail referencing the famous Disney Park monorail systems. I thought it was such a clever idea for brand continuation to bring their magic from the real world to the online world.

Unlike today, it was a time when websites looked all different from each other, web design was more experimental and interesting. It seems the industry is trending that direction again, hopefully the web will look more diverse in a few years without bringing back the closeness, lack of security, and inaccessibility that Flash had.

## Acknowledgement

The monospace fonts used in all code samples belongs to the font family called [Mono Lisa](https://monolisa.dev). I was going to used Source Code Pro to be consistent with Source Serif Pro and Source Sans Pro, which I use as the heading fonts and body fonts respectively. But I do find Mono Lisa’s larger counter and longer x-height design more appealing and legible, and it looks great in the logo.

The website is built with the Node.js-based static site generator, [Elevety](https://11ty.dev). I like it because it‘s fast and flexible, and I can manage all dependencies in the same package manager (NPM).
